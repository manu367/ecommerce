* `POST /api/auth/register` — Register user
* `POST /api/auth/login` — Login and return JWT

### 📦 Product Management

* `GET /api/products` — Get all products
* `GET /api/products/:id` — Get product by ID
* `POST /api/products` — (Admin) Add new product
* `PUT /api/products/:id` — (Admin) Update product
* `DELETE /api/products/:id` — (Admin) Delete product

### 🛒 Cart & Orders

* `POST /api/cart` — Add to cart

* `GET /api/cart` — View cart

* `DELETE /api/cart/:productId` — Remove item from cart

* `POST /api/orders` — Create order

* `GET /api/orders` — View user's orders

* `GET /api/admin/orders` — (Admin) View all orders

### 🛡️ Middleware
